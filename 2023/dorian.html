                    <li class="body">Dorian is a 104 page asemic epic poem, typesetted and digitally bound book. The poem is written by the artist, along with a reimagined method of writing—cut-up technique— popularised by the Dadaists in the early 1900s. Dorian is a virtual anti-artistic object that speaks of the fatality of the digital, absurd labour, and parting. The original goal was to create something with no purpose or predetermined idea and to merely resemble meaning, questioning paradigm shifts in mediums of writing and publishing.<br><br>

                        This work is part of a three work series called Dorian, a commentary on our romanticism of the physical and antiquated.

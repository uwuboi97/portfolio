                    <li class="body">Letter To is an open letter to art and its practitioners. The text is written emphatically and at once by the artistâ€™s hand and  is hardly legible and seemingly without meaning (asemic). The practice of asemic writing rationalises itself in the repetitive motion of writing and dissection of language. It comes purely from body and flesh not towards a point of singular meaning, but an infinite intertextuality. Its lack of immediate semantic meaning leaves the reader to interpret and navigate, an effort is required and the act of viewing becomes an exchange between artist and reader.

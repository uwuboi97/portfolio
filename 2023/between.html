                    <li class="body">Inspired by the craft circle, Between the covers of our daydreams is a process-oriented project that aims to nurture the haptic, analogue and digital encounters of craft within the premise of an exhibition space.<br>
                        The artists are examining elements of techne and the processes of making, alongside considerations of materiality, colour fields, intimate labour and the social production of the commissioned and existing works. An extensive programming of gatherings, workshops, panel discussions and conversations will also bring many makers, curators and writers to the circle.<br>
                        
                        Within this showcase, there is a conscious desire to document transformative acts against forgetting. The mixed media works are a culmination and expansion of the conversation of crafting by way of extending the processes and techniques involved. Acknowledging the fact that there is strength in togetherness, this project hopes to narrate differing traditions into our present day reality. <br><br>
